This program was developed during a Python workshop at the Perth Python/Django meetup (PDPD) on Febrary 1 2018.
The challenge was to create a Roman Numerals calculator using Python working in teams of 4. My team collaborated
on algorithm ideas, but then each one of us coded our own program.

The initial commit shows my program as it was presented to the meetup at the end of the session. While not as
fully developed as some that were presented, it serves as an example of coding under time "pressure".
